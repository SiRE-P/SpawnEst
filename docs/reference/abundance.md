# Extract abundance estimates

Extract annual spawner abundance estimates from a fitted spawnBayes
model.

## Usage

``` r
abundance(fit, CI = c(66, 95), outlier_p_thresh = 0.25)
```

## Arguments

- fit:

  A fitted spawnBayes model.

- CI:

  Credible interval widths to report.

- outlier_p_thresh:

  Probability threshold used to classify surveys as potential outliers
  when reporting annual outlier counts.

## Value

A data frame containing annual abundance estimates. Output includes
posterior median abundance estimates and credible intervals. When an
assumed residence time was supplied during model fitting, traditional
trapezoidal area under the curve (TAUC) abundance estimates and the
percent difference between the posterior median and TAUC estimate are
also reported.

The output additionally includes a logical `multimodal` flag identifying
years with evidence of multiple major run timing peaks and, when an
outlier observation model was fitted, the number of surveys within each
year having posterior outlier probabilities exceeding
`outlier_p_thresh`.
